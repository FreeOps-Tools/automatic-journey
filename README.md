# Automatic Journey

**Automatic Journey** is another tool aimed to be designed to automate the deployment process for software developers. With its integration with GitHub, it'll allows users to select their repository and explain how they want to deploy it. From there, the tool generates a YAML file for a GitHub Action that is tailored to the user's description. Once created, this GitHub Action will automatically trigger whenever the specified event occurs, making the journey to production smoother and more efficient.

In addition to automating deployment, **Automatic Journey** might also assist with other tasks involved in the software development process. For example, it might later be developed to help with code testing and quality assurance, ensuring that code is thoroughly tested before deployment. It might also help with code analysis, identifying potential bugs and issues before they become a problem.

Overall, **Automatic Journey** is likely to become a powerful tool that can save developers time and effort by writing an automation yml file intergrate with github action to help automating many of the tasks involved in the software development process. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this tool can help streamline your workflow and get your code into production faster.
